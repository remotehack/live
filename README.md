"The Podcast"

## background

We decided to start doing a remote hackday back when the covid-19 lockdowns started
in March 2020, and then it was so much fun we just kept doing it.

The site for the remote hack is [https://remotehack.space](https://remotehack.space). 
We have a [Discord](https://discord.gg/C4bW8v6Bf6), [issue tracker](https://github.com/remotehack/remotehack.github.io/issues), and all that fun stuff..

Something we were missing, however, was a way for people to see what we were up to
on the day without needing to join all the chats/zooms/etc.

So we came up with the idea of a podcasts, which led to the idea of some microcasts.
These would be extremely short podcast episodes during the hackday to do things like
interview remote hack participants, talk about the different hack ideas, and
generally relax and have a good time.

The episodes will probably only be a minute or two long, and we're hoping to be
able to do cool things with them like auto-transcribe and put them in VR or other
silly ideas that are fun and not immediately useful.
