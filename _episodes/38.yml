title: Episode 38 - Ben and Max talk about the recent improvements to the podcast
description: Ben and Max were too busy hacking today so didn't get a chance to participate in the earlier podcast episodes that were recorded this month, so they have to guess what was discussed, and discuss the merits of the format. Definitely episode 37.
